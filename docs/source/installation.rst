=============
Installation
=============

Prerequisites
-------------
:mod:`SPARCS` only requires that your system has Snakemake and the `conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`_ package manager installed.
All other dependencies are handled by Snakemake directly. You can check that both are installed by running::
    
    conda -h
    snakemake -h


Downloading the pipeline
------------------------
To download the pipeline, simply navigate to the directory of your choice and run::

    git clone https://github.com/The-Bevilacqua-Lab/SPARCS.git

And that's it! You should now see a folder titled "SPARCS" in your working directory.
